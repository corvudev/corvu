# Introduction

Corvu is a collection of open source UI primitives for <Link href="https://solidjs.com/" text="SolidJS" newTab /> that are unstyled, accessible and aim to be highly customizable while providing a delightful developer experience.

> üöß Corvu is still under heavy development and in its very early stagesüê£. Please be aware of that while using it. New primitives will be available soon. Stay tuned!

## Features
### Unstyled
Primitives do not provide any styling, allowing you to bring your own and style them according to your preferences or style guidelines. You can use TailwindCSS, any CSS-in-JS library or plain old CSS to style it. We provide a small [TailwindCSS plugin](/docs/styling/#tailwindcss-plugin) which makes it easy to style components based on their current state. Read more in [Styling](/docs/styling/).

### Unopinionated
Corvu allows you to customize almost every aspect of all primitives while providing great defaults. There is an API section for every primitive describing all the available props and their default values. Read more in [State](/docs/state/).

Corvu also provides a set of [utilities](/docs/overview/#utilities) like `createFocusTrap`, `createPreventScroll` and `createPresence` that can be used to build your own accessible primitives.

### Accessible

All primitives have been developed with accessibility in mind. They strictly adhere to the <Link href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/" text="WAI-ARIA" newTab /> guidelines and take care of all the complex stuff like aria attributes, focus management and keyboard interactions. The documentation describes the accessibility features implemented for each primitive and how to change them according to your needs.

### SSR
Corvu provides a `solid` export for SSR and works out of the box with <Link href="https://start.solidjs.com/" text="SolidStart" newTab/>.
