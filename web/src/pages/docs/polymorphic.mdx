# Polymorphic component

All primitive components which render a DOM element, are polymorphic. This means that you can modify the element or the component they should render as. Corvu gives you two ways to accomplish this:

## The `as` prop
This property accepts any `ValidComponent` (a string or a Solid component) and tells the primitive component to render it instead of the default one. For example, here's how to render a dialog label as a "p" element instead of the default "h2":

<Code code={`
<Dialog.Label as="p">My Dialog</Dialog.Label>
`} lang="tsx" />

Or with a Solid component:

<Code code={`
const MyCustomLabel = (props) => <p>{props.children}</p>

<Dialog.Label as={MyCustomLabel}>My Dialog</Dialog.Label>
`} lang="tsx" />

Props not belonging to the primitive component will be passed to the component you defined.

## The `asChild` prop
The only case where you will have issues with the approach above is when your Solid component accepts an `as` property. Because we use this property already for our polymorphic component. For this case, you'll have to use the `asChild` property.

By defining this property, you tell the polymorphic component to render as the first `<As />` component it finds in its children. This allows you to use the `as` property for your component.

<Code code={`
import { Dynamic } from 'solid-js/web'
import { As } from 'corvu'

const MyCustomLabel = (props) => (
  <Dynamic component={props.as}>{props.children}</Dynamic>
)

<Dialog.Label asChild>
  <As component={MyCustomLabel}>My Dialog</As>
</Dialog.Label>
`} lang="tsx" />

> 💡 You might have seen react libraries accomplish the same without the need for an additional `<As />` component. Unfortunately, this isn't possible in SolidJS because children are generally just DOM elements.
