# Controllable Signal

When you're building an unopinionated component, you might want to give the user the option to control its state. For example, a `Dialog` component might have an `open` state which the user can take control of. The `createControllableSignal` utility allows you to pass an optional signal which will be used as the state instead of the internally managed signal.

## Usage
<Code code={`
import { createControllableSignal } from 'corvu'
`} lang="tsx" copyButton />
<Code code={`
const Dialog: Component<{
  open?: boolean
  onOpenChange?: Setter<boolean>
  initialOpen?: boolean
}> = (props) => {
  const [open, setOpen] = createControllableSignal({
    value: () => props.open,
    defaultValue: () => props.initialOpen,
    onChange: props.onOpenChange,
  })

  return (
    <Show when={open()}>
      <div>Dialog</div>
    </Show>
  )
}
`} lang="tsx" copyButton />
