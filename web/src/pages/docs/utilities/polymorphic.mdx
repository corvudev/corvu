# Polymorphic

The `<Polymorphic />` component is an extended version of Solid's <Link href="https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#dynamic" text="<Dynamic />" newTab /> component and allows you to additionally render as the first `<As />` component present in its children. It is used in all primitive components of corvu which render an element. Check out the [Dialog](/docs/primitives/dialog) primitive for examples.

## Usage
<Code code={`
import { Polymorphic, As } from 'corvu'
import type { PolymorphicProps } from 'corvu'
`} lang="tsx" copyButton />
<Code code={`
const Button = <T extends ValidComponent = 'button'>(
  props: PolymorphicProps<T>,
) => {
  return (
    <Polymorphic as={props.as} asChild={props.asChild}>
      {props.children}
    </Polymorphic>
  )
}

<Button as="a" href="https://corvu.dev">
  corvu
</Button>
`} lang="tsx" copyButton />

### asChild
If you happen to have a component that uses the `as` prop for itself, you can use the `<As />` component in combination with `asChild`:
<Code code={`
<Button asChild href="https://corvu.dev">
  <As component={MyCustomComponent} as="a">corvu</As>
</Button>
`} lang="tsx" copyButton />

> 💡 You might have seen react libraries accomplish the same without the need for an additional `<As />` component. Unfortunately this isn't possible in SolidJS because children are generally just DOM elements.
