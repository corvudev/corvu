# Transition Size

Utility which makes it possible to transition the width and height of elements that don't have a fixed size applied.

<PackageInfo packageName="solid-transition-size" />

## Features
<Features features={[
  'Works with any CSS transition configuration',
  'Specify which dimension to observe (width, height, or both)',
  'Uses a ResizeObserver to detect changes in the size of the element',
]} />

## Installation

<Code code={`
npm install solid-transition-size
`} lang="bash" copyButton />

## Usage

The utility returns two signals: `transitioning` and `transitionSize`. `transitioning` can be used to know when the transition is happening, and `transitionSize` returns the fixed size of the element while transitioning. You **have** to use it to style the element you want to transition.

<Code code={`
import createTransitionSize from 'solid-transition-size';
`} lang="tsx" copyButton />
<Code code={`
const Details = () => {
  const [ref, setRef] = createSignal<HTMLElement | null>(null)
  const { transitionSize } = createTransitionSize({
    element: ref,
    dimension: 'height',
  })

  const height = () => {
    if (!transitionSize()) return undefined
    return transitionSize() + 'px'
  }

  return (
    <details
      ref={setRef}
      class="transition-[height]"
      style={{
        height: height(),
      }}
    >
      <summary>Show detail</summary>
      Detail
    </details>
  )
}
`} lang="tsx" copyButton />
